missing prompt at start of game.
prompts should be on the same line as the input (use print not println)
Level choice selection is weird and looks like it is part of the header not a choice.  Also why is b back and 1 is the choice.  Make this consistent.
pauses take way too long.  Makes the game extremely slow, especially at the start.
move is said after the damage which is a weird order.
Your game is loading pokemon with their price as their damage.
Charizard is going down in level for winning fights.
Can never advance past lvl 2?
Information of pokemon is not being saved properly either. Hp is being reset.

Probably could have been a bit easier if you had spread things out a little more for interactions to make the coding of the game easier (create methods similar to the way we did in problem set 4)
Remembe to simplify coding as much as possible and not make a huge amount of if statements and loops when unnecessary.  Also use methods to break up code more.


Great job on comments and javadocs.
